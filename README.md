This web-based single-page application (SPA) is a voice-activated teleprompter, i.e., it automatically scrolls the text you are reading as you are reading it. It is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). I routinely use it with my [Elgato Prompter](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/prompter) to create [my own YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@darkskygeek). Such software already exists, but it is either rather expensive, or not robust enough. For example, the free online software created by Teleprompter Mirror [[link](https://telepromptermirror.com/telepromptersoftware.htm)] easily gets confused if you go off script or mispronounce too many words, and as a result, it will stop auto-scrolling. This is why I built this app.

**Note:** It supports both English (`en-US`) and Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`) speech recognition. The app automatically detects your browser language and defaults accordingly, but you can manually select your preferred language using the dropdown in the toolbar. It was tested only in the Chrome web browser and will likely not work in other web browsers!

You can try it live [here](https://jlecomte.github.io/voice-activated-teleprompter/dist/).

**Instructions:** Once you've opened the live demo, click on the `Edit` button in the toolbar. Paste your script into the content area and click on the `Edit` button again to validate. Then, click on the `Play` button in the toolbar and start reading your script. If you need to take a break, you can click on the `Stop` button at any time, and then later resume the transcription by clicking on the `Play` button again. You can also click on individual words in your script to reset the transcription to a specific index in case you need to re-read a section of your script.
